# Enterprise Software Implementation - Frontend Implementation using React

This project deals with the digitalisation and automation of a fictitious medium-sized production company and has the goal to improve processes and transparency for the customer (company).

This repository is meant for a clean versioning and development of the frontend functionalities. It is developt in combination with the repository "ESI_PROD_2020_Lambda" which includes the backend parts (Lambda functions) corresponding to this frontend webapp.
Here you see an overview of the services and how they play together:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm (Alternative is yarn)
- Editor, for example https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Webbrowser, for example Firefox

In the project directory, you can run:

### How to install and start the App with NPM
When the folder is downloaded and unziped make sure to run 'npm install' in the directory first, to download all dependencies and node modules needed for the framework. This has to be done every time you add or modify the package.json file.
Afterwards, run 'npm start' to start the app locally under http://localhost:3000

Here are some useful informations regarding the react documentation:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
